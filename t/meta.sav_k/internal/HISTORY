4 Feb 2009:  First "internal public" release.

             Known problems:
               - mixed/dra still not available;
               - tabling/eager_tabling has some minor problems in comments
                 as well as some unnecessary inefficiencies;
               - a very limited set of examples.

5 Feb 2009:  Second "internal public" release:

               Fixed:
                 - trace did not work in the Eclipse version of
                   "eager_tabling";
                 - removed one source of inefficiency (and disparity between
                   the code and the associated comment) in "eager_tabling".

6 Feb 2009:  Third "internal public" release:

               Fixed:
                 - In "eager_tabling" trace also internal events (e.g.,
                   adding a pioneer).
                 - The sanity-checking functions of the LTL interpreter
                   were unable to report an error when run in the tabling
                   interpreter.
                 - "translate_colp" had a spurious choice point which caused
                   a false error message if the user asked for more
                   solutions.
                 - Wrong permissions on many files.

13 Feb 2009:  Fourth "internal public" release:

                 - Added "dra".
                 - Deleted "eager_tabling", as superseded.
                 - Deleted "mixed", everything is now in "tabling".
                 - More small examples.

16 Feb 2009:   Fourth "internal public" release:

                 - Really deleted "eager_tabling" ;-).
                 - Found a couple of errors in "dra".
                 - "dra" checks consistency of declarations with definitions.
                 - "dra" gives priority to new answers (this can be changed
                    by using ":- old_first ...").
                 - The wallpaper trace is more informative.

19 Feb 2009:   Fifth "internal public" release:

                 - "dra" is in its own module.
                 - "bottom" renamed to "support" in "translate_colp".
                 - "support" and "load_support" implemented in "top_level".
                 - "dra" can now handle "support".

24 Feb 2009:   Sixth "internal public" release:

                 - Various incompatibilies between the Eclipse and Sicstus
                   versions of programs ameliorated.  Was able to remove
                   several .ecl files, as their .pl versions can be run on
                   both systems.
                 - Suppressed a few minor errors caused by changed
                   conventions.
                 - Added checking for singleton variables.
                 - Improved the format of longer diagnostic messages.

27 Feb 2009:   Seventh "internal public" release:

                 - "dra" now has common code for both systems, only tiny
                   shell files remain.
                 - Queries are no longer checked for singleton variables.
                 - Implemented checks for undefined predicates and predicates
                   that are defined but not called: gave meaning to
                   ":- top ...".
                 - Updated a number of examples with top declarations, to
                   suppress the new warnings.
                 - Brought the LTL examples in line with the latest
                   improvements (particularly "support").
                 - Various small improvements.

 2 Mar 2009:   Eighth "internal public" release:

                 - The LTL example has been improved with a check for
                   well-formedness of the formula.
                 - The check for singleton variables takes into account \+/1
                   and fail/0.
                 - Various small improvements.

 3 Mar 2009:   Ninth "internal public" release:

                 - Fixed a problem with user interaction on Sicstus.

13 Mar 2009:   Tenth "internal public" release:

                 - In "dra" activated "essence_hook" for matching with
                   coinductive hypotheses.

                 - Fixed the LTL verifier to take care of the error
                   discovered by Brian DeVries.  The verifier now produces
                   counterexamples.

                 - Introduced an LTL verifier in straight Prolog (for
                   comparison). This is still experimental and incomplete.

31 Mar 2009 :  Eleventh "internal public" release:

                 - Fixed several errors.

                 - The LTL verifier in straight Prolog has been rewritten.
                   It now works on all examples, but there is no proof that
                   the rewrite rules need no extension.  The program is
                   tabling/examples/LTL/v.pl.

                 - Improved the LTL coinductive/tabling verifier: no looping
                   when printing counterexample, better consistency checking,
                   less duplication of code.

                 - A new directive added to "dra": the user can now inspect
                   the answer table.

                 - A minor extension of "dra": statistics about the number of
                   steps and about the size and growth of the answer table
                   are now produced after every query.

                 - The declarations of allowed built-in predicates in "dra"
                   have been factored out from the interpreters into separate
                   files, to facilitate extension.  findall/3 has been added.

                 - The stack of tabled ancestors and the set of coinductive
                   hypotheses have been factored out of "dra_common.pl" to
                   allow a change to a more efficient representation.  The
                   representation has been changed to open binary trees.  The
                   hope is that this will make performance degradation more
                   graceful as applications get larger.

                 - The top level now checks for contiguity of predicates,
                   stores predicates in "defined/1".

                 - The program files have been prefixed with a standard
                   copyright notice and disclaimer.

                 - "dra" prints out its version when loaded.

                 - A separate user manual for "dra" is now available.

                 - We are now ready for a real public release, pending a
                   review and a sanity check by a second person.  We also
                   need more hefty examples of tabling programs from othe
                   places.

2 Apr 2009 :  Twelfth "internal public" release:

                 - Added copyright/disclaimer notice to "DRA User Manual".

                 - Tweaked XSB examples.

                 - Fixed two errors in program analysis.

                 - Added term expansion to allow processing of DCG rules.

                 - Added Gopal Gupta's mini-language example.

                 - Releasing this as a beta candidate (Version 0.9 (beta)).
