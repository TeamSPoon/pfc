This directory includes the following files:

boolean_operations.pl:
        Evaluation of simple boolean expressions.

clause_verification.pl:
        Utilities for checking whether clauses are well-formed.

checker.pl:
        This is a general utility for checking a file with a Prolog program.
        It is tailored to SWI Prolog.
        It could be improved to take into account modules and inclusion of
        files.  DCGs are not properly checked, either.

compatibility_utilities.ecl:
compatibility_utilities.pl:
        Predicates that hide some incompatibilities between Eclipse and
        Sicstus.

dlist.pl:
        Basic operations on difference lists.

errors_and_warnings.pl:
        Utilities for producing diagnostics (and aborting execution in the
        case of errors).

goal_table_in_tree.pl:
        A data structure for keeping Prolog goals, implemented as an open
        tree of open lists.

goal_table_simple.pl:
        A data structure for keeping Prolog goals, implemented as an open
        list.

higher_order.pl:
        A few predicates for higher order operations (simulating some basic
        operations known from functional programming).

io_utilities.pl:
        Utilities that have to do with input and output.

Makefile:
        Creates a stand-alone clause checker (advanced checking for singleton
        variables).

olist.pl:
        Basic operations on open lists.

open_set_in_tree.pl:
        Simple operations on open sets, used by utilities.

otree.pl:
        Basic operations on open trees.

program_consistency.pl:
        An auxiliary of top_level: checks general consistency of the loaded
        program.

output_equation.pl:
        Ronald de Haan's predicates for converting a cyclic term to a set
        of equations (used in top_level.pl).

README:
        This file.

set_in_list.pl:
        Simple operations on smallish sets, used by utilities.

top_level.pl:
        A simple top level (i.e., code that reads and stores programs,
        executes queries etc.).  It is loaded automatically by those
        metainterpreters that need it.

utilities.pl:
        A set of useful predicates, loaded and called by the other programs.
        Loads also most of the other utility files in this directory.

vardict_utilities.pl:
        Utilities that have to do with variable dictionaries.
