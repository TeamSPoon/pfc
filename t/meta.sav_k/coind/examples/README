This directory includes the following files:

automaton.clp:
        An example of an omega-automaton, due to Horst Reichel of Technical
        University at Dresden, Germany.

comember.clp:

        A modified version of Example 2 from Luke Simon's Ph.D. thesis.

comember_comp.ecl:
        This is comember.clp translated into Prolog.  The translation
        was done by hand, so it is more readable, but essentially the
        same as an automatic translation performed by
        "../translate_colp".

conditional.clp:
        A wholly uninteresting example, designed to test that "../colp"
        handles conditionals correctly.


NOTE: Other examples of programs that use coinduction (as well as
      tabling) can be found in ../../mixed/examples.
