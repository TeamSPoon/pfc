This directory includes the following files:

colp.ecl:
        A very simple interpreter for co-logic programming, almost
        exactly as it appeared in Luke Simon's Ph.D. thesis.

        It can be executed by loading in an example that includes it.

example2.clp:
        Example 2 from that same thesis.  Just load it into your
        favourite logic programming system, then issue some queries.
        File "../examples/comember.clp", which is essentially the same
        example, contains some example queries.
